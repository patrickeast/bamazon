# bamazon

Bamazon is a node-based CLI application using a MySQL database and a server connection. Through a series of prompts, the application displays a list of items currently for sale, and then gives the user an opportunity to make a purchase. If the quantity requested is greater than the current stock quantity, then an _insufficient quantity!_ message appears. If the quantity requested is less than or equal to the current stock quantity, the user gets a message showing that the purchase was successful, and shows the total purchase price for the items. 

**Future Add-Ons**

I would like to continue this project, creating Manager and Supervisor roles. I would ultimately like to gamify it by giving the user a random amount of funds once the application is run. The user will then be given the products without their prices, and s/he will need to guess the items and quantities to purchase to get as close to a balance of $0.00 as possible, without going negative.
